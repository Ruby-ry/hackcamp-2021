# Welcome To Activism On Board

Our project **_Activism On Board_** features a online community platform for exploring social activism and movements. 

At **_Activism On Board_**, we've made it easy and accessible to get involved in something you care about.
Users can explore current events through a few clicks, and gain insight on the latest movements.

### How It Works

‚Üê `Movements`: Learn more about a Movement through its description, and follow a Movement to stay updated on Posts. 
‚Üê `Posts`: Posts may include anything from stories, resources, and upcoming events to show the latest information on a topic. 
‚Üê `Users`: Promote self-expression by customizing your profile with a username and avatar to reflect your beliefs.
‚Üê `Community`: Connect with others who are learning about the same Movements and embrace new Movements!

### Our Mission üìÉ

‚Üê To spread social activism towards a diverse audience 
‚Üê To provide an accessible platform to explore what you care about
‚Üê To build a supportive community of users who are passionate about global causes

## Inspiration
Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest, Savee.it

## What it does
Movements 

## How we built it
Figma, React, React-Bootstrap, Wrouter

## Challenges we ran into
- setting up sass to work with glitch
- getting all the technologies to work together
- figuring out which color palettes would be accessible

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Getting the React code to function and getting rid of the error messages
- Making the adorable capybara images (Thanks to Ruby!)

## What we learned
- We learned how to use React, Read and edit prototypes as a team on Figma, Export the code to GitHub, and use Wrouter
- it takes a lot of effort and research to create a website that's truly accessible for all, but doing so can make a user's life easier
(which makes it worth it)

## What's next for Activism On Board
Due to the time limit of the hackathon, we were not able to finish implementing all of the social movements that we wanted to include.
In the future, we hope to incorporate APIs such as the Twitter API, GetDayTrends API, and so on to selectively help us find social movements so that we can be
as inclusive as we can be!

Additionally, we hope to implement private messaging system so that users can connect further with other users with similar interests.
