# Welcome To Activism On Board

Our project **_Activism On Board_** features a online community platform for exploring social activism and movements. 

At **_Activism On Board_**, we've made it easy and accessible to get involved in something you care about.
Users can share and explore current events through a few clicks, and gain insight on the latest movements.

### How It Works

‚Üê `Movements`: Learn more about a Movement through its description, and follow a Movement to stay updated on Posts. 

‚Üê `Posts`: Posts may include anything from stories, resources, and upcoming events to show the latest information on a topic. 

‚Üê `Users`: Promote self-expression by customizing your profile with a username and avatar to reflect your beliefs.

‚Üê `Community`: Connect with others who are learning about the same Movements and embrace new Movements!

### Our Mission üìÉ

‚Üê To spread social activism towards a diverse audience 

‚Üê To provide an accessible platform to explore what you care about

‚Üê To build a supportive community of users who are passionate about global causes
